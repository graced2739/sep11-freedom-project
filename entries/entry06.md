# Entry 6
##### 6/1/22

I finally finished all parts of my project. This includes the presentation to both the judges and the entire class. Overall, I feel like both me and my partner did very well on both of those presentations. For the presentation for the judges, we had to write an elevator pitch to introduce ourselves, the tool we use and a brief rundown of what our project is and what it does. Here is our elevator pitch: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hjpkaHDxl7JUqFdlcBqFF7MIWbt3NcWguPqRm0WJLA/edit?usp=sharing.
