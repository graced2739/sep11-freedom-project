# Entry 6
##### 6/1/22

I finally finished all parts of my project. This includes the presentation to both the judges and the entire class. Overall, I feel like both me and my partner did very well on both of those presentations. For the presentation for the judges, we had to write an elevator pitch to introduce ourselves, the tool we use and a brief rundown of what our project is and what it does. Here is our elevator pitch: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16sq6bjA4Tzv9S05zmJa_n01E-EAXv8AVI1qMKO25mPs/edit?usp=sharing, it's on the bottom of the freedom project unit.. Me and my partner were both able to memorize this script completely but when we had to speak to the judges, we rushed through the script quickly due to the fact that we only had a few minutes to show off our project. It was even worse due to the fact that we were the first group to present so we didn't have prior experience presenting to someone else. It was also loud in the cafeteria so I should've been louder and more captivating, grabbing attention as the judges gave us a 3 on presentation out of the full score of 4. But I feel like we were able to impress the judges by showing them what we made and explaining how our templates, send email, and create events to google calendar work. This was how we got a 3.5 on usability and a 4 on practicality. I am still confused on why we got a 2.5 on creativity as we made sure to made beautiful and colorful templates. Overall our first time giving our eleavtor pitch was our worse, but as more students and teachers came to our project, we were becoming more confident presenting our project and showing our hard work. We also showed them the emails that were received and opened up google calendar to show that that the events written in Google Sheet did in fact get sedn to Google Calendar. So we used our first experience to improve on later experiences. 

For our presentaion to the whole class, we did great! The only comment we got from the teacher was to make more eye contact. This is someting I should imrpove on because the majority of the time I was looking at the screen. I think that after I explain a slide I should look around the room and not go directly to the next slide.  Throughout the presentation we were both loud and clear. We also explained how our code worked really thoroughly, our hook was interesting and our conclusion summed up everything perfectly. The only reason that we were able to do this was because me and my partner rehearsed on zoom and wrote speaker notes to make our thoughts organized and consise. And even though we weren't able to remember every single word of the speaker notes we were still able to explain our code efficiently as we already knew what to say.
