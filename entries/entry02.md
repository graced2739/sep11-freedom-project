At first I just started with written tutorials from GoogleAppScripts itself: [Link to GoogleAppScripts](https://developers.google.com/apps-script). But then after using that to learn, I began to feel more confuse because I had no idea what certain codes do. <br>

* getActivespreadSheet()
* getActiveSheet()
