Right now I've finished learning watching the videos for my tool. But I actually stopped watching up to [Google Sheets - Send Emails Using Apps Script JavaScript MailApp Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcNmur6xiX4&list=PLv9Pf9aNgemv62NNC5bXLR0CzeaIj5bcw&index=12&t=1599s). The reason why I stopped watching tutorials when I came to this video was because the videos after, were unnecessary. I did not need things such as dropdown lists, cross tabs, and combining multiple sheets in one for our homework planner. I also reconsidered watching the playlist for [Google App Scripts- Web App](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv9Pf9aNgemt82hBENyneRyHnD-zORB3l). The reason why I reconsidered watching these videos was because our homework planner is on a Google Sheet, we don't need to display it on a web page, we definitely could and try but that would take too much time. But it wasn't like I didn't learn anything new, my partner introduced me to buttons when using Google App Scripts. Basically when you click on a button, using Google App Scripts you can make a specific function run. Seeing hopw useful that is I decided to learn it myself and came upon this short yet informative YouTube video:[Google Sheets Button to Run Script: How to Create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e73I-5FkL7E). <br>
From this video I learned that you first have to create a button by going to insert-> drawing and then create a button using any shape you want, basically you can customize the button however you want.
