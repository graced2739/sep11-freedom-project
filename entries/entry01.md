The tool I decided to use is GoogleAppScripts. The reason why I chose this tool was because it's very explanatory with clear tutorials both on the website and on YouTube. The tool is powerful and can be used on Google Sheets, Google Calenders and even on Gmail. What GoogleAppScript does is that it adds customs, menus and sidebars on Google Docs, Sheets and Forms. It writes custom functions and macros to Google Forms and build add-ons onto Google Doc, Sheets, Slides and Forms.
