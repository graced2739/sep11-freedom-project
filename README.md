# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Grace Dong

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about choosing a tool related to javascript and using that tool to create a project that's serves a purpose in our lives. The purpose of this blog is to walk through the tool I picked, the process of how I learned the tool and how we used that tool to make our product.

## Content
For my project, I am making a Homework Planner in Google Sheets. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying GoogleAppScripts in order to make the Homework Planner.
